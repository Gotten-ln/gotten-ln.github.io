All you need to pack on muscle is a simple pair of dumbbells

## Bent-Over Row

**Muscles worked:** lats, shoulders, forearms and biceps, spinal erectors, hamstrings and glutes.

**How:** Keep your core tight and your back straight as you row the weights up to your chest. Lower and repeat.

**Why:** “Rows will target several muscles in your upper body including the traps, rhomboids, lats and biceps perfect for getting you that ‘V’ shape,” says Frost. And not only that, it'll hone in on your deltoids to create some T-shirt-filling boulder shoulders, too.

## Dumbbell Bench Press

**Muscles worked:** Pecs, shoulders, triceps, forearms, lats, traps and rhomboids.

**How:** Lie on a flat bench holding two dumbbells over your chest with an overhand grip. Push up until your arms are straight, then lower under control.

**Why:** If you’re looking to build quality pecs appeal then always opt for a dumbbell press over barbell. Why? A weight in each hands allows for a greater stretch at the bottom of the lift, building a bigger chest. And if you want to take this move further? “Squeeze your pecs together at the top of the lift to recruit as many muscle fibres as possible,” says Frost.

## Cross Body Hammer Curl

**Muscles worked:** Biceps, brachialis, and forearms.

**How:** One at a time, curl each weight up towards your opposing shoulder. Return under control to the start position and repeat on the other side.

**Why:** Remember, if you want to win the arms race then don’t ignore the rule of divide and conquer. Focusing on one arm at a time creates a large neural drive, which engages the nervous system to recruit more muscle fibres.
